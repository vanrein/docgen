Document Generation Center
==========================

    This software uses LaTeX to perform high-quality formatting of
    dynamic documents requested by a web client.


Introduction
------------

The web is filled with content in HTML, but some applications require better
formatting than the primitive formatting that browsers offer. Strangely,
there is no webbish-dynamic approach to the generation of such high-quality
dynamic documents.  So, here it is.

To deliver the highest quality, this docgen utility uses LaTeX. It's a
big advantage that LaTeX is a batch program too!

The documents are generated from LaTeX documents with PHP insets. These
insets may contain dynamic information, including even depency on such
things as the browser-set language preferences!

The lib/generate.php script is a generic script that can generate different
forms of output, including PDF, PostScript, LaTeX and DVI. It passes on
all variables that it receives in its URI.

Make your own Dynamic Document
------------------------------

To make your own dynamic document, first write it in LaTeX. Then, replace the
variable parts with PHP code, using any variables that you like, except the
reserved ones.

Currently, reserved variables are $out, $template and $langidx. And of course
all special variables in use by PHP and Apache themselves.

Make a web form in which the variables are filled out. Include the file
lib/outputformats.php in the form, as well as a hidden input type
	<INPUT TYPE=HIDDEN NAME=template VALUE=xxx>
where the name of your template goes in xxx. Your lib/settings.inc tells you
what is prefixed and postfixed to xxx to form the template URI.

Now tell your form to use the GET method, and define ACTION=lib/generate.php
and it should all work!

Be smart, and always set up your web form in PHP, since you seem to have that
supported anyway. A PHP file can just be HTML, but it can in the future be
extended to much smarter things, automatically guessing defaults, for example
filling in a date as a default entry.

Another hint: Make your forms look their best on lynx on a 80x2[45] terminal.
Filling out out forms is *much* more pleasant in lynx than in any graphical
browser!


Security
--------

LaTeX allows rather powerful commands, including those that manipulate files.
To avoid opening security holes, these commands should not be made available
to web clients. It would be very simple to enter a command like
	\input{/etc/passwd}
in a name entry field, so we must avoid this.

To do so, your should insert a PHP statement
	require ('../lib/websecurity.inc');
after all legal file actions (notably, the \usepackage statements you need) and
before the first insertion of a variable provided as a script parameter.

The examples provided make heavy use of Victor Eijkhout's Dutch letter style,
which makes really impressive letters.

LaTeX, this utility, and Victor Eijkhout's document class are all available
on CTAN, http://www.ctan.org.

PHP is a programming language used chiefly to make web pages (very) dynamic.
It also serves quite well to demonstrate that Open Source development leads to
far better (more powerful *and* more efficient) products than the obvious
Commercial Alternative. PHP is (very) well documented (another better point)
on http://php.net

Finally, PHP works best in Apache. Apache's success story is quite similar
to PHP's. Apache is found at http://www.apache.org.
